  "description": "Superfund is a United States federal environmental remediation program established by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). The program is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The program is designed to investigate and clean up sites contaminated with hazardous substances. Sites managed under this program are referred to as Superfund sites. This podcast consists of readings of the EPA's official narrative summary for every Superfund site on the National Priorities List, with modification or commentary. The full list of sites is available on the EPA's website.",
